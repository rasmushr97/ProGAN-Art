# ProGAN-Art-Pytorch
An implementation of ProGAN used to generate paintings. The project uses images from the WikiArt dataset. Below there is a few example of the images produced by some models trained in this project. The results could have been a lot better with some more training, but it was difficult with a lack of compute power. I Also think it could be improved by using the class label from the wikiart dataset as input for the generator, since image in different classes are very dissimilar.
